1. Input Processing Module
2. Decision Making Module
3. Task Handling Module
4. Response Generation Module
### 3. Decision Making Module
Log the user prompt and the LLM decision like so:
```
import os
from uuid import uuid4
from time import time

def save_file(file_path, content):
	"""Save content to a file specified by file_path."""
	with open(file_path, "w") as file:
		file.write(content)

def log_decision(user_prompt, llm_decision):
	"""Log the decision-making process for a user prompt."""
	# Generate a unique identifier for the log entry
	new_id = str(uuid4())

	# Prepare the log text
	log_text = f"USER Prompt: {user_prompt}\nLLM Decision: {llm_decision}"

	# Format the filename with the current timestamp and the unique ID
	filename = f"decision_logs/log_{new_id}_{int(time())}.txt"

	# Save the log entry to a file
	save_file(filename, log_text)

	# Optional: Print or return the path of the saved log for confirmation or further processing
	print(f"Log saved to: {filename}")
	return filename

# Example usage
user_prompt = "What is the capital of France?"
llm_decision = "No"  # Assuming the decision is made elsewhere and passed here
log_decision(user_prompt, llm_decision)
```
We use the same LLM that interacts with the user to ensure it has the contextual awareness of the full conversation.
We do, however, clean the conversation history from the operational exchanges around the decision making.
#### Direct Response Generation
1. Restore the conversation history
2. Generate and display the response
#### Pass on to Task Handling Module
